## Project setup instructions

These instructions will get you a copy of the project up and running on your local machine for development.

### Prerequisites

```
Editor
Git
Github account
```

### Installing

When you create a repository on GitHub, it exists as a remote repository. You can clone your repository to create a local copy on your computer and sync between the two locations. Here is a series of steps on how to set up the project on your local machine.

Click [Password Manager ](https://github.com/MutuaFranklin/Password-Manager) to navigate on the main page of the project repository on Github.

```
Clone the repository using HTTPS, click "Clone with HTTPS".
```

```
Open Terminal. Change the current working directory to the location where you want the cloned directory.
```

```
Type https://github.com/MutuaFranklin/Password-Manager and press Enter to create your local clone.

```

## BDD
As a user, I would like to;
- Create a password locker account with my details, a login username and password.
- Store my already existing account credentials in the application. Assuming I already have a twitter account, I want to store my already existing twitter username and password in the application.
- Create new account credentials in the application. For example, if I have not yet signed up for Instagram, I would want to create a credentials account for Instagram in the application and the application generates a password for me to use when I sign up for Instagram.
- Have the option of putting in a password that I want to use for the new credential account. For example, when creating my Instagram credential account, I want to have an option of putting in the password I want to use instead of having the application generate a password for me.
- View my various account credentials and their passwords in the application.
- As a user, I want to delete a credentials account that I no longer need in the application.

## How to Run

- Then run "chmod =x run.py" command to make the program executable on the terminal

- Follow the instructions to signUp, LogIn and to navigate across the application
